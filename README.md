Project Ignite 2016

Project Advisor: Ashley Wong

Group Members: Will Aracri & Kyle Carskadden

This is an iOS App Development project, the brainchild of both group members, supported by the project advisor as part of their Project Ignite project. The app is a simple-geometric basketball shooting game. Projected goals for this app include donating a certain amount of money to local Pittsburgh charities from local Pittsburgh businesses.

Project Ignite is a student run outreach organization at Carnegie Mellon University offering a project-based educational program that provides an opportunity for high school students to collaborate with and receive mentorship from CMU students in developing passions in subjects they can pursue at a higher academic and professional level. Our vision is that all students, regardless of socioeconomic standing or prior academic achievement, will have the opportunity to participate in the program. We are serving students by providing them with the funds, knowledge, and mentorship-based support to pursue an interest by undertaking a project that is either proposed by our Project Advisors or by the applicant. We will group high school students with our Project Advisors from CMU, who will help lead these groups through this project over a 10 week period during spring semester.
